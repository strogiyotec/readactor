Let's write a terminal based text editor (Like Vim but dumber and smaller)

## Status
I have no intention to continue working on this project. The original idea for 
this project was for me to become familiar with how vim works internally. I found however that it's really boring. Terminals have special ascii codes to move cursor and react on special keys such as F1-12,Enter etc. Those characters are conter intuitive. 

# What I learned ? 
1. Implementing Text editors is not as hard as I though.
2. How to interact with system calls using Golang
